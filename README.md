# A Synopsis Of C

<br />
<br />

In this short synopsis of the C programming language (as the title suggests), you will find out everything from it's origins, history and use cases. <br />
Enjoy, all you "Cool C Coders"!



<h6> P.S: If you dont code in C, and instead are just reading to get an overview on the language or to... read, then feel free to still call yourself a Cool C Coder. Don't worry, we have you covered! </h6>

## Chapterhouse: C

According to the smart minds at `collinsdictionary.com`, a chapterhouse is "a building attached to a cathedral, collegiate church, or religious house in which the chapter meets". <br /> <br />
In other words,

<br />
<br />

C programmers are their own religion.

<br />
<br />

Now, I don't say this in a rude way- Writing programs in C is an *`art`*. <br />
It requires extensive knowledge of computers: memory, bytes and notwhat. A good amount of patience and skill is needed. <br /> <br >

The ordinary man cannot write C code. Only a brave soul destined to be one of the greats can dare challenge this beast of a programming language!


<br />
<br />

Okay, okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves. C programmers obviously aren't part of a religion... <h5> right? </h5>

No, they're not. But, C programmers have every right to brag about their language (don't worry, they aren't being mind controlled by Ken Thompson). If you see any extraordinary programs, reality bending and mind boggling concoctions of code, then they're probably written in C. 
If not, their foundations were made in C code. What do I mean by this? Well, C is the basis for almost every programming language to date. That's not info to be taken lightly: lists such as the `TIOBE Index` estimate there are around 700-900 programming languages to date. That's a lotta C. `(Si, senor!)`
