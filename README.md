# A Synopsis Of C

<br />
<br />

In this short synopsis of the C programming language (as the title suggests), you will find out everything from it's origins, history and use cases. <br />
Enjoy, all you "Cool C Coders"!

<br />

>  P.S: If you dont code in C, and instead are just reading to get an overview on the language or to... read, then feel free to still call yourself a Cool C Coder. Don't worry, we have you covered!

## Chapterhouse: C

<br />
<br />

*A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street* <br />
  *- Doug Linder*

<br />

According to the smart minds at `collinsdictionary.com`, a chapterhouse is "a building attached to a cathedral, collegiate church, or religious house in which the chapter meets". <br />
In other words,

<br />
<br />

C programmers are essentially their own church.

<br />
<br />

Now, I don't say this in a rude way- Writing programs in C is an *`art`*. It requires extensive knowledge of computers: memory, bytes and notwhat. It takes a good amount of patience and skill. <br />
The ordinary man cannot write C code. Only a brave soul destined to be one of the greats can dare challenge this beast of a programming language!
